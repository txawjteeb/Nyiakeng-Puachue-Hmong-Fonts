# Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong Fonts

The first known font creation of the Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong Fonts started in May 1, 1993. Though the script conceptualization started many years ago in the 1980s by Reverend Cher Vang Kong. He was tasked by General Vang Pao during their meeting in Santa Ana, CA to try and develop the Hmong language and script for the Hmong language use. It was known during the time that the Hmong RPA written system was a script that was not sufficient for future Hmong language development and was not able to fully capture the whole Hmong language. The Hmong RPA system was popularly attributed to Dr. William Smalley, Dr. George Linwood Barney, and Father Yves Bertrais (also popularly known as Txiv Plig Nyiaj Pov).

After several years of research all over Laos, Thailand, and even in China where the Hmong people known to have lived in History, Reverend Cher Vang Kong began developing the script that he was tasked in the early 1980s. Several years after, General Vang Pao, along with other Hmong leaders, gathered to meet and discuss the progress of the tasks and action items that were assigned. After Reverend Cher Vang Kong had reported his research and development of the new script, General Vang Pao had disregarded his work and imprudently stated that General Vang Pao had already submitted a different Hmong script to the United Nations official language department (This may have been due to the wider prejudice feelings in the Hmong community towards the Hmong who have converted to Christianity).

Afterwards, the development and progress of the scripts became more in use in the church that Reverend Cher Vang Kong had founded, United Christians Liberty Evangelical Church. The script had been implemented into type writers, hymnals, videos, books, banners, teaching/educational materials, and many others. The script spreaded rapidly in the late 1980s and early 1990s within the churches and started to become more well-known and exposed outside of the church to the Hmong community and even outside of the United States. Some materials and books written in Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong can still be found outside of the United States such as France, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, China and Australia.
